# DSA Assignment 2 Test Suite (HCMUT - Semester 252)

A comprehensive test suite for DSA Assignment 2.

This project supports **multiple execution modes** for flexible and targeted testing.

---


## Setup

Replace the provided files with your implementation:
- `AVL.h`
- `ThreadedAVL.h`
- `Playlist.h`
- `Playlist.cpp`


## Build

### Basic AVL mode
```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -I . include tests/assignment2_test.cpp src/Playlist.cpp -o test_basic
```

### Threaded mode (bonus):
```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -DUSE_THREADED_AVL -I include tests/assignment2_test.cpp src/Playlist.cpp -o test_threaded
```

## Run

### Run all tests

```bash
./test_basic
./test_threaded
```


### Run by category

```bash
./test_basic [mode]        # AVL mode
./test_threaded [mode]     # ThreadedAVL mode
```

#### Available modes:

| Mode        | Description |
|------------|------------|
| `all` (default) | Run all tests |
| `song`     | Test `Song` class |
| `avl`      | Test AVL (insert, delete, balance) |
| `playlist` | Test Playlist functionality |
| `stress`   | Run stress tests |
| `threaded` | Test ThreadedAVL *(only for `test_threaded`)* |
| `help`     | Show usage and available test modes |

### Run specific test suites

You can also run individual test suites:

- `song`
- `avl-basic`
- `avl-rotation`
- `threaded-avl-basic`
- `threaded-avl-erase`
- `playlist-order`
- `playlist-nav`
- `playlist-remove-current`
- `playlist-remove-head`
- `playlist-score`
- `playlist-random-approximate`
- `playlist-approximate-steps`
- `playlist-compare-edge`
- `playlist-duplicate`
- `stress`

## Testcase Guide

This test suite validates both **correct output and internal behavior** of your implementation.

Each test provides:
- PASS / FAIL status
- Expected vs actual result
- Code location of failure

### How to debug

1. Run the test and locate the **first FAIL**
2. Read the **test message** (it describes expected behavior)
3. Check the corresponding function in your code
4. Compare:
   - Return value
   - Internal state (e.g. `currentIndex`)
5. Fix and rerun

### What is being tested

#### AVL / ThreadedAVL
- BST property (ordering)
- AVL balance (height difference ≤ 1)
- Correct insert / erase / traversal
- Iterator correctness (ThreadedAVL)

#### Playlist
- Correct sorting (by title, then id)
- Playback logic:
  - `playNext`, `playPrevious`
- State management:
  - `currentIndex`
  - `hasCurrent` (ThreadedAVL mode)
- Edge cases:
  - Empty playlist
  - Invalid index

#### Advanced features
- `getTotalScore` (sum of scores)
- `compareTo` (compare first k songs)
- `playRandom` (update playback state only)
- `playApproximate` (move index with step)

#### Stress tests
- Large input size
- Ensures no crash and correct complexity

This test suite was generated and refined with the assistance of AI.  
While it aims to follow the official assignment specification and forum clarifications, it **may still contain inaccuracies or incomplete assumptions**.

If you encounter inconsistencies, please refer to:
